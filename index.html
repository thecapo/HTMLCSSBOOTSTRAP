        <p>Geo Omori opened the first jiu-jitsu / judo school in Brazil in 1909.[6] He would go on to teach a number of individuals including Luiz França. Later, Mitsuyo Maeda was one of five of the Kodokan's top groundwork (newaza) experts that judo's founder Kano Jigoro sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. Maeda had trained first in sumo as a teenager, and after the interest generated by stories about the success of Kodokan Judo at contests with other jujutsu schools that were occurring at the time, became a student of Jigoro Kano.[7] Maeda left Japan in 1904 and visited a number of countries[7] giving "jiu-do" demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters and various other martial artists before eventually arriving in Brazil on November 14, 1914.[8]

        Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belém. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda.[9][10] In 1917 Carlos Gracie, the eldest son of Gastão Gracie, watched a demonstration by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided to learn judo. Maeda accepted Carlos as a student and Carlos learned for a few years, eventually passing his knowledge on to his brothers. Sibling Hélio Gracie gradually further developed Gracie Jiu Jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation from judo that focused on ground fighting, as he was unable to perform many judo moves that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength.[11]

        Although the Gracie family is typically synonymous with BJJ, another prominent lineage started from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple, Luiz França.[12] This lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his students were famous for influential use of footlocks[13] and the lineage still survives through Fadda's links with today's teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team.[14]</p>

      <p>I graduated a Diploma in Software / Website Development in Box Hill TAFE in Melbourne.  The course covered HTML, CSS, Java, Android Studios, Javascript, MySQL, Wordpress and .NET(Visual Basic and C#).<br><br>  
However, I am keen on learning and building a career as a Ruby on Rails Developer. I purchased tutorials online and is always on a look out for new technologies along with Ruby on Rails.  May it be from youtube, blogs or shared ideas from a colleague.
With Ruby on Rails I was able to build a basic CRUD and did automated testings (using RSpec). I am also in the process of learning other tools in Ruby such as FactoryGirl, Capybara, Database Cleaner, Faker and Shoulda-Matchers.  I am always motivated to solve any challenges and celebrate the big and small accomplishments. I join meet ups  and hack nights in Melbourne to learn new things and improve my social skills. <br><br>
To get to know on how I code, you can check my GitHub account www.github.com/thecapo.  The projects I did with Ruby is the ZenTicket and BasicCRUD. Also my GitHub account consist some of my assignments I did in school. As for my Ruby on Rails projects I did a coding challenge for Zendesk which I did a Ticket Viewer. The code will be connected to their API, request all the tickets inside the account, display a it in a list, show individual ticket details and pagination. The BasicCrud is just the basics and applied what I learned.
Currently I am trying to build an app. For ideas, I try to find jobs in upwork. I get those I believe I can do and try to build it. <br><br>
Prior to coming here in Australia, I have worked as a Graphic Artist. The job entails clipping path, image manipulation, photo editing, cropping, designing, tracing and resizing. I am also doing freelance jobs in freelance sites like upwork and freelancer. I do have almost 11 years experience. I am very knowledgeable with Photoshop.
